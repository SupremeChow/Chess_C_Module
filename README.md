# Chess_C_Module
I hate C. This is a C module of the game Chess made for a class project for Linux operating systems. It is a sort of contuation of the TicTacToe module. Therefore, I again hate working in operating systems and C. In this instance, the AI computer is not actually implemented, and if I recall just does random available moves. Last time I checked and tested, the module worked, but again assume the worst. Moreso, this project was worst than the tic tac toe module so it is more likely to have isues. The code was privately uploaded from another account for school. I hate C.
